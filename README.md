# Computer Vision Assessment

This project demonstrates a basic application of computer vision techniques using Python. The core objective is to perform image processing and object detection using OpenCV and other essential libraries.

## Features

- Image loading and preprocessing
- Object contour detection
- Use of OpenCV for drawing bounding boxes
- Edge detection using Canny
- Real-time camera capture support
- Structured, readable code output (rendered via Jupyter Notebook / HTML export)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy opencv-python
